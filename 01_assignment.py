# assignment examples

# You can assign "values" to "variables" by using =
x = 5

# when python reads a variable name it replaces it with the variables stored value
y = x + 5

# theres 4 diffrent primitive data types
# intergers; an y whole number positive or negative
age =  16
#float: any number with a decimal positive or negative
grade = 98.6
#string; a string of human readable characters that are counted as letters 
name = "chris"
favoritenumber = "3"
#boolean; true or false
# true is any value that isnt false or empty
isSmart = True

# you can output using print
print(age)
print(name)
print(grade)
print(isSmart)
print(favoritenumber)

# you can concatenate values together
print("my name is " + name)
# Use functions to covert data types
print("and my age is " + str(age))
# assign the converted value to a variable if you want it converted permanently
age = str(age)
# you can covert types with int() str() bool() and float()
print(int(age))
print(float(age))
print(bool(age))
